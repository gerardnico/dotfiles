# Note:
# Running wsl (bash.exe) without arguments (or with the ~ argument) will launch bash as a login shell.

# Executed when the terminal is starting (ie non-interactive)
# On Windows, the terminal is started with: `wsl.exe --distribution Debian`

# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
