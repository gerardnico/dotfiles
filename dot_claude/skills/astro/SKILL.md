## Astro Project Instructions

* Use TypeScript.
* Refer to [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build) for framework-specific questions.
* By default, if the page type is not specified, created pages should be in a `mdx` format
* If a new React component need to be created, it should be stored in a subdirectory of the `src/components`
  directory. The React subdirectory component should have the same name as the component. For instance, a `H1`
  component would be stored as  `src/components/H1/H1.jsx`. All other dependency files of the React component should
  be stored in the same directory as sibling.
  For instance, a stylesheet should be stored as `src/components/H1/H1.css`
* For styling, use bootstrap class. Refer to [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/) for framework-specific questions.
